Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Education at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am also a Doctoral Researcher for the Highly Mobile Youth project and Alternative Education in California project at the [Center for Transformation of Schools at UCLA](https://transformschools.ucla.edu).


About My Research
-----------------
A central question guiding my research is: 

*How can we develop inclusive and high-quality educational and workforce systems that can empower individuals to reach their fullest potential, foster creativity and productivity, promote well-being, and cultivate empathy and social cohesion in a world increasingly shaped by rapid technological advancements and growing social inequalities?*

My research integrates perspectives from the political economy and sociology of education with psychosocial theories of human learning and motivation to examine the participation, engagement, and outcomes of individuals and communities in educational and organizational contexts. Specifically, my work focuses on:
1.	Investigating how organizational structures, cultural norms, and socio-environmental factors shape individual learning experiences and influence key outcomes such as skill formation, well-being, and career growth.
2.	Leveraging large-scale administrative and survey data to uncover systemic patterns in education and workforce dynamics and build a portfolio of evidence for informed decision-making
3.	Translating research findings into actionable, equitable, and sustainable policies and practices that advance workforce development, lifelong learning, and social cohesion.
